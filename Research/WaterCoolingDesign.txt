_Maintenance_
Spot corrosion seems to occur rapidly during prolonged stagnation. Coolant should drained if machine will not be used for an extended period of time.

Coolant replacement at 6-12month intervals seems typical. Methanol coolants may be more corrosive, especially in the presence of contamination and oxygen, suggesting more frequent coolant replacement.

Metal surfaces exposed to coolant should be regularly checked for corrosion. Especially true for methanol coolants, where leakage presents a safety hazard.

_Fluid_
EthyleneGlycol mixtures including corrosion inhibitors as well as algicides are traditional, and relatively safe. However, methanol offers inherent biocidal properties, superb low temperature protection, and most importantly, actually improves viscosity.

Herein is a tradeoff between reliability and maximum performance. Best approach may be storing a full supply of both types of mixtures, using a methanol based solution only when justified by performance gains.

-Methanol-
30% Methanol
70% Distilled Water

Warning: Methanol fumes are highly toxic, possibly flammable. Corrosion thus presents a safety hazard, and this mix may be more corrosive than pure water.

-EthyleneGlycol-
"Phobya ZuperZero Xtreme Coolant - 500mL (Concentrate)"
OR
3% Premium Antifreeze
97% Distilled Water
Silver Killcoil

Note that automotive antifreeze may contain inappropriate chemicals, like sodium silicate, with the possibility of clogging.

_Metals_
Waterblock surfaces exposed to coolant should be exclusively copper/bronze/silver, to minimize risk of catastrophic coolant leakage.

Aluminum should not be used anywhere in the system.

_Closed/Open_
True open-loop evaporative coolers boil off their coolant into an open environment. Even with water, cooling to ambient or below is possible given a sufficiently large evaporative surface area. Continual loss of cooling fluid, exposure to an external microbial infestation, and apparent lack of sutible commercial products are major drawbacks.

Closed-loop watercoolers simply move the heat from a high-density spot (ie. chip) to a low-density surface (ie. radiator). Typically, the air-cooled radiatior is a limiting factor, with commercial units like the Cooler Master Nepton 280L achieving 22.6degC/340W at two low-profile 120mm fans. However, the sealed system may be more robust.

In the end, a custom closed-loop system may be engineered to maintain ~1kW loads at near ambient, with ~4 thick 120mm variable speed fans. For a workstation, this kind of reliable, quiet performance may be idea. Hardcore overclockers may then add ports and valves for quick connection of an evaporative cooler when justified.
