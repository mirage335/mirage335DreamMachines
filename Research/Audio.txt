Audio hardware can be used for analog signal conversion, especially when isolated, DC coupled, and/or mixed with more versatile hardware.

Asus Xonar DX (50kHz Low Pass)
Asus Xonar D1 (Full Bandwidth Suggested)
Essence STX II (Configurable, High Bandwidth Stated)
Xonar DSX (Cheap, Possibly Configurable)
Xonar DGX (Cheap)
BEHRINGER U-PHORIA UMC202HD
Behringer U-PHORIA UMC404HD



# Assumptions
* DC Coupling.
* High Frequency cutoffs from built-in antialiasing filters.
* Possibility of substantially better cost-effectiveness from dedicated ADC/DAC.
* Real-time synchronization with external ADC/DAC.
* Cost of additive mixing with external ADC/DAC.
