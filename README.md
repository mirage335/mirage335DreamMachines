OBSOLETE UNTIL FURTHER UPDATES.

Intel and NVIDIA products should currently be considered NOT RECOMMENDED FOR NEW DESIGN.

Poor support commitment to end-users has been demonstrated by both companies. 
* Performance degradation after sale (Intel).
* Probable worst-case latency impacts (Intel).
* Attempting to spin to security flaws (Intel).
* Proprietary drivers (NVIDIA).
* Abuse of driver EULA (NVIDIA).

VR applications in particular may be more likely to encounter persistent framerate degrading bugs due to delays in processing IO requests.

Hardware acqusition strategies should now shift to less expensive equipment, prioritizing complete replacement rather than upgrades. Increasing support for alternative processor architectures, improved competiton in semiconductor fabrication, and the possibility of a poorly aligned business model, renders the value of a vendor's upgradable components much less certain. Shifting more frequently to lower-power systems is likely to also improve ecological sustainability.

Transparency, down to chip hardware designs, should be considered evidence of lower depreciation risk.

# Base
Basic high-value machine optimizes the cost of current hardware and power consumption, somewhat at the expense of upgradability. AMD seems to be a current industry leader in this mid-range market.
