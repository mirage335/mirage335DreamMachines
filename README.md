Optimized computer configurations, generally at least twice as cost-effective as similarly performant prebuilt machines.

# Base
Basic 'best performance per dollar' machine optimizes the cost of current hardware and power consumption, somewhat at the expense of upgradability. AMD seems to be a current industry leader in this mid-range market.

# Workstation
High-end workstation. Cost-effective as a cryptocurrency mining rig, without wasting the opportunity for intermittent desktop use.

# Lightweight
Lightweight servers can be served by a "LapRack" approach - a RasPi connected to a USB battery and two OpenWRT routers. Low-power, compact, portable, and reliable.

# Details

Intel and NVIDIA products should currently be considered NOT RECOMMENDED FOR NEW DESIGNS.

Poor support commitment to end-users has been demonstrated by both companies. 
* Performance degradation after sale (Intel).
* Probable worst-case latency impacts (Intel).
* Attempting to spin to security flaws (Intel).
* Proprietary drivers (NVIDIA).
* Abuse of driver EULA (NVIDIA).

VR applications in particular may be more likely to encounter persistent framerate degrading bugs due to delays in processing IO requests.

Hardware acqusition strategies should now shift to less expensive equipment, prioritizing complete replacement rather than upgrades. Increasing support for alternative processor architectures, improved competiton in semiconductor fabrication, and the possibility of a poorly aligned business model, renders the value of a vendor's upgradable components much less certain. Shifting more frequently to lower-power systems is likely to also improve ecological sustainability.

Power supply, fans, and liquid cooling components are a possible exception, as some of these may be useful for multiple generations of new computer systems.

Transparency, down to chip hardware designs, should be considered evidence of lower depreciation risk.
